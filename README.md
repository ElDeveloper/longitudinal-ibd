# Guiding longitudinal sampling in inflammatory bowel diseases cohorts

[Supplementary Materials](./Supplemental Materials.ipynb)

This repository includes all the source code, tests and notebooks to generate
the figures used in the (Vazquez-Baeza et al. 20XX).

The raw sequences for this study are not provided as part of this repository,
instead we point to Qiita where, raw sequences, quality-controlled data, OTU
tables and sample information are all made publicly available. Whenever
possible we include data that will make the analysis easier (for example, alpha
and beta diversity data is included, but can also be re-computed).
