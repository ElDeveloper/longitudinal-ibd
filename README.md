# Guiding longitudinal sampling in inflammatory bowel diseases cohorts

This repository includes all the source code, tests and notebooks to generate
the figures used in the (Vazquez-Baeza et al. 20XX).

The raw sequences for this study are not provided as part of this repository,
instead we point to Qiita where, raw sequences, quality-controlled data, OTU
tables and sample information are all made publicly available.

The notebooks assume that we have access to a folder `gg_13_8_otus` where the
Greengenes 13_8 database can be found.
